# Background
In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving job market, understanding the dynamics of demand and compensation is crucial‚Äîespecially in data-driven roles. This project was initiated to provide clarity in the landscape of data analyst careers by analyzing a large dataset of job postings from 2023. The goal was to uncover patterns in salary distribution, identify which skills are most valued, and highlight the alignment between high-paying roles and specific technical competencies. By distilling key insights from real-world data, this project aims to assist job seekers, career switchers, and data professionals in making informed, strategic career decisions

## Data Source

The job postings data was sourced from the [Jobs Dataset](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_title,
    CASE 
    WHEN job_location = 'Anywhere' THEN 'Remote'
    ELSE 'Onsite'
    END AS job_location,
    job_schedule_type AS job_schedule,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

```
